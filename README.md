# Airline-Reservation-System
This C language project will work to reserve a seat for the passengers. Users could book flight tickets by entering their basic information as input, such as the passengerâ€™s name, phone number, age, seat number, flight timings, etc. The project will also allow the user to review the provided information again and search their entered data by the name or seat number.
