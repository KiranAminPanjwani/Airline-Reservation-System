# Airline-Reservation-System
This C language project will work to reserve a seat for the passengers. The tickets could be booked using the user's basic information as input, like the passengerâ€™s name,  phone number, age, seat number, flight timings, etc. The project will also allow the user to review the provided information again and search their entered information by the name or seat number.
