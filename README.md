# Airline-Reservation-System
The project will work to reserve the seat for the passengers. The tickets will be booked  on the basis of basic information which the user would input, like passengerâ€™s name,  phone number, age, seat number, flight timings, etc. Project will also allow the user to  review the provided information again and search his/her information by his name or  seat number.
